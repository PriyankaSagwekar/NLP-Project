Great 4.5 L Air fryer. Works nice. Looks great!,4.0,"First review : Got this a week back and so far I have extensively used to Bake a cake, Made Mathri, Buttermilk chocolate cookies, Manchurian Balls. Reheated restaurant tandoori chicken etc.The recipe is given in booklet and you need to adjust it to lower temperature with higher time for required doneness.Still trying to understand how to get the cake baked from bottom. As heat is from above. Its trial error and learning like an oven.Overall great product, at economical rate.4.5 liter size is pretty big for families of 3-4 people. No plastic smell in first usage.Got extra warranty from onsite go too for peace of mind.",3 February 2021
An emerging brand that is gonna give a tough competition,5.0,"The fryer feels premium and is working really well. I kind burnt my first batch of French Fries while experimenting tho. Please use the preset if it's available and mid way pause it and shake it a bit to get an evenly baked/fried item. The Recipe book they provide is handy üôåüèª.Note: When you touch the Power/Pause button you gotta wait 20 seconds for it to turn off.The best part is the customer support. Very polite and answers your queries patiently. You can reach them via email or WhatsApp. As long as we don't use any abrasive material to clean it, the teflon coating doesn't come off...if you or someone mishandles it, worry not as you can reach out to them and purchase a replacement. One less thing to worry about.Get it while the prices are still low and it is a very good investment.Happy Healthy Eating : )",26 March 2021

Air Fryer with a difference but seller,4.0,"This is a fryer that is all plastic and has a non-stick pan inside. Easy to use to fry, grill and even bake.The most important feature is that it remembers the function if there is a power failure in between - so starts exactly where it stopped which is a good feature. I think this is not mentioned anywhere but good to have.If you find this review helpful, mark it below.Enjoy a healthy living!",11 February 2021
Excellent Air fryer,5.0,"We got Varada Air fryer in a day. Good fit and finish. The bowl is large and good quality metal. We have tried ""Hash browns"". Perfectly cooked with almost no oil. We have just brushed one teaspoon oil on 5 pieces. All of them have come out nice, crispy and golden brown. Recommending this product.",4 April 2021
A happy experience,5.0,"Received it today and got started, read the manual and precautions noted. Air fryed potatoes french fries style and the results were good, realized that the type of potatoes used is important to get the crispy outcome. Next, tried tandoori chicken indian masala style, result was simply awesome, succulent and just the right texture and taste, did not overcook. Here are the temp and timing: tandoori chicken as shown in the picture, temp 160 ¬∞C time 6 mins turn and 6 mins, 12 mins total. Cooling time 2 mins ... Observations: the noted say practice makes perfect sense, this is the mantra here, more practice more success. The temp and timing parameters are easy to set. However, the only way you will know whats happening inside the fryer is by checking mid way of the cooking process, having said that, the fryer is a time saver, hassle free cooking, oil free cooking, with delicious bookmark results. Overall a very happy experience indeed.",14 February 2021
