   To  be honest I didn't know air fryers exist, until my mother had a samosa cooked in an air fryer at her friends house. She liked the oil free samosa and that's when we decided to buy it too. Researched it on the internet and found this one by American Micronics to be very good. We didn't want to spend big on the brands like Philips cause we didn't know if we would develop the taste for oil free food/snacks.It arrived in a very secure packaging, we just unboxed and kept it in the kitchen. It is big in size compared to the pics. I didn't imagine it to be this big, it requires good amount of space, may be how much an oven would require approximately.The fryer doesn't make noise when its on and there should be a decent gap from all 4 sides and top cause the fryer release a very hot air and intakes air from the top. Over all the built quality is very good. The pan and base inside have a very good coating, everything that drips from the pan gets collected in the base and its very easy to remove those stains. Always use scotchbrite yellow soft sponge to clean the pan and base, anything hard and you will scratch the coating.We made fryums, potato smaosa's, spring rolls, baked fish, chicken and everything turned out better than what we expected. Very little oil was used, as good as no oil and everything was very well cooked and crisp from the outside and moist and soft on the inside.You can message American Micronics on whatsapp (find the number in the product description) and ask them for the recipe book. The book is very helpful and they are quick to reply on whatsapp.Time taken approx to cook:Fryums- 3-4 mins, shake after 2 mins at 160 degreesFish- 2 fishes at a time, 4 mins each side at 190 degreesChicken- 4-5 medium pieces, 8-9 mins each side at 190 degreesPotato samosa- 4-5 samosa's, 4mins each side at 200 degreesSpring rolls- 4-5 rolls, 4mins each side at 180-190 degreesYou can try your own settings or alter the setting I mentioned as per your requirements of crispiness and golden color desired.Always pre-heat the fryer before cooking anything, atleast for 3mins at 180 degrees. When cooking fish, chicken it is advised to take a couple of drops of oil on fingertips and rub it on the whole fryer pan before keeping whatever you want to cook, a silicon brush would be ideal actually to apply the oil properly and evenly.",2 June 2019
Review after 2 years,1.0,"I purchased this in 2017, and have been using this once in a week till date. However the non stick coating has come off now and spare baskets are not available. It’s not great as the basket is toxic now.Basket is not available as spares in Amazon. Contacted the OEM customer care, they were prompt till to make a prompt in sharing a link for a spare, but turned deaf post that.So summary, go for this if you get a spare basket along with the new unit, or else go for something like Philips.",20 October 2019
Great buy,4.0,"After using this frier for over a month , I can say I like it. I have done potato wedges, fish, chicken legs and wings and a few more items and they came out as expected.For chicken legs - 20 mins - turn the chicken after 10 mins and spray oil , for wings - 10-15 mins , for fish 10 mins - depnds on how crispy you want the skin to be.The greatest benefit is the saving in oil as otherwise fish and potato needs to be deep fried to reach the same level as with the frier. There's not much operational issue and no complaints so far. This frier worked out cheaper than Philips and we are enjoying it quite often.I can recommended this for the health benefits as also for the convenience.",3 December 2018
Quality not great,1.0,I order3d this product and for 1 month it was working great. After which the fan stopped working. I contacted the replacement team for pick up and they told me that motor got damaged due to which fan stopped working. They replaced with new one but not sure how much that will run on longer scale.,14 March 2018
An extremely well built and useful product,5.0,"I bought this in June 2017 and am writing the review after 2 years of rigorous use. All I can say is that the airfryer has repaid it's cost to me twice over. I use this regularly with at least 10-15 uses in a month. It forms a critical component for my family's healthy eating. No issues whatsoever till now. The fryer works like a charm despite pretty rough use and abrasive manner of cleaning from our cleaners. Yes some of the non-stick coating from the lower bowl has peeled off but the basket is still going strong. I was quite apprehensive about this purchase two years back but can totally vouch for it now. I even recommended this to my in laws a year back and even their unit is going strong. Nowadays it is usually hard to come by real value for money products, especially online. This is however a real exception with excellent vfm. Go for it but follow the maintenance and washing instructions for a long life. Do not clean it like your daily use kadai and you will be good to go for a long time.",11 August 2019
Value for money,5.0,Fantastic product easily beat Philip products. I used it and the food preparation is devious,11 January 2019
No Regrets Yet,5.0,"I was confused between the Phillip's, BMS and this air fryer. While Philip's is good but only when bought from an authentic seller. I came to the conclusion after reading a lot of the negative reviews on the Philips airfryer. I did not want to bother myself with a defective piece and then having to return it to get a good product again.BMS is good and cheap but I did not want to experience the plastic smell while cooking.So I bought this one instead. I do not regret buying it for as of now. The machine is bulky but not loud. Though I must admit that I like the taste of oil fried potatoes more than air fried ones.  But it's a healthier approach and it's faster than ovens.The date today is 4th October 2019. I'll let you guys know if it breaks down before 2 years.",4 October 2019
Okeyish for daily use,3.0,"Air fryer is not bad. Well worth money? Kinda. Why?Pros :1. Easy to operate2. Big pan and basket3. The pan itself built with grill4. Detachable basketCons :1. No cooking book2. No additional grill3. Even though the wattage is high, it takes more time to cook4. The body slightly heats up5. The pan in the basket is slightly shaky6. Slightly heavy",4 April 2019
A healthy way to perfect cooking,5.0,"Just one word, KFC@home !No oil, no fuss, just paste butter or olive oil on anything and its cooked to perfection.  Just love it, and lots of space, never take anything smaller.  Its healthy cooking option for those with cholesterol.  Only con is that its barely enough for 3 so you may need to prepare in batches, but still 5 stars because what it does, it does well.",3 April 2018
A must-have for an electric kitchen,5.0,"I am reviewing after 1 years and 2 months and the device works trouble free after daily use. But you have to gather a lot of experience about what can be done in this and what cannot and the timing after a lot of trial and error. Although I have a fully-equipped kitchen I do not have gas. It is difficult to deep-fry in flat-bottom induction-compatible vessels, this is where this device comes as a solution. It can make excellent french fries, papad (both roasted and fries) and samosas.Points to note:1. All vegetables cannot be fried here with equally satisfactory results, you have to try and see. Potatoes, banana chips are ok while potol (parwal) or brinjal does not give satisfactory results. I brush a little oil alongwith salt for a deep fry and without oil for a bake. But it a bit more time than deep frying, but takes much less oil while making it equally crispy and lesser chance of burning.2. Cakes can be baked if oven doesn't work.3. Puri or other very high heat deep fries cannot be made.4. For batter fry items I shallow fry in oil a bit to harden the batter and then put in this for the rest of the frying. It can hold more items than a typical frying pan. I reguarly batter fry different vegetables like eggplant, fish eggs, spinach, jute leaves5. Bread-crumbed items like chicken nuggets and burger patties can be made, with no or little oil.",25 May 2020
Good quality air fryer.,5.0,Have been using it for about 2 weeks now. Works well. Build quality is good. Size is huge for family of 3. Earlier I had Bella 2.2lt model. We could use it to make 5 bread rolls. This one is 3.5 lts and we were able to make 9 bread rolls in one go.,8 May 2018
"Perfect pricing , works as expected . Highly recommended",4.0,"The pricing was the iceing on the cake. Got it during Amazon sale for 5500 rs with 750 rs instant cash back . It's a steal deal when Philips is easily 30% more. A veteran user tested out the product . She has been using philips for a few yrs. The conclusion was it does everything well . Long term review will follow in a few months. First attempt was with marinated chicken cubes and result was good enough. First batch was a little overcooked but the remaining came out well. Overall satisfied. Durability will be monitored over the course of time.Update after 1 month - working fine , using to make french fries , chicken fry etc. Recommended product",21 October 2019
Good to buy,5.0,"After many research I did purchase this product with less confident...but product doesn't it job and my family enjoy cookingAdvantage : Basket size is big...but if we put more quantity it takes more timeWe tried with french fries, chicken, veg fries cake etc....it's good for health concious people's",14 March 2018
DAMM GOOD FOR THE PRICE POINT!!!!,5.0,Used an air fryer for the first time in my entire life and was amazed to see what i was missing out on ...tried to cook some french fries  and chicken tandoori today and to my surprise both came out super delicious and pretty much cookedmoreover i managed to deep fry them by using 83% less oil.totally recommended!!!!,3 August 2017
Worst Warranty Service,2.0,"Warranty service are pathetic. I have following up for the past month for warranty repair and there is no response from American Micronics. Product is good, bt don't expect any support from American Microns for service and repair. buy at your own risk",18 April 2019
basket and handle are not the best,3.0,"Although it's an affordable air-fryer, I would like to point out some cons after a year of usage. As everyone has pointed out the basket paint scrapes off after regular use. Secondly, given it's size the handle is not proportional and as a result my handle is now broken! the screw has come out and I have not been able to put it bac in place. I hope I can contact customer service for the spare part!",7 May 2020
great product.,5.0,great product.....recipes needed a bit of modification and we had to re-train ourselves a bit to get the optimum results....good cooking implement for those trying to avoid/reduce fat content of various daily items of food/snacks....!!  the 3.5l capacity of the bin and the 1500w power level were the main decisive points in its favour....,7 November 2017
Received defective piece,1.0,After many days of search found that american-micronic  air fryer is having a good review but unfortunately i delivered with a defective piece . Waiting for the replacement .New one didn't switch on itself  . May be defective piece or packaging issue ---> waiting for response,29 March 2019

Easy to handle and not much of tension to use. Getting used to it. Kids are happy to get their french fries etc. whenever they want now... Good one. Thanks",5 September 2017
Simply Must for health cautious...,5.0,"Simply Must for health cautious...Sturdy built, nice looking...Enjoyed making Gujarati recipe Ghughara (sweet) with just a half spoon ghee for frying done by brushing.Zero or half spoon for french fries (still need practicing from myside).Made salted mathadi with just teaspoon oil.Please note oil while preparing dough is just enough, additionally you need only brushing in most of the items.Ask for pdf recipe book to WhatsApp number +91 88820 09988 their service center number. It's difficult to find number. Number should be on box itself along with bill/warranty card as insert.Easy to clean.Value for money....Cons: 1. Standard Accessories like stand for double layer cooking, pan, clippers to take out pan etc. should be included.2. Bracket for holding fryer at the back side above/below hot air escape went is given should be there as bringing fryer pan out without support when unit is hot is slightly awkward. However this is more like suggestion to improve for manufacturers as it's not available in other brands too.Go for it if you are health cautious...I am using American Micronic oven since last 2 years and happy with its sturdy quality so brought this fryer.Happy frying....",20 November 2019

"Sturdy appliance, Value for money",5.0,Spacious cooking basket.Good sturdy finish. The cooking basket seems sturdier than some other air fryers I had seen in showrooms.Quiet fan.Cooks well.Can easily recommend for anyone to buy it as it is reasonably priced too.Need to align properly when closing the basket. One always has to adjust the basket to push it in place.Otherwise seems like a good value for money product.,7 August 2019

It's better to buy a conventional oven which almost costs the same.",23 December 2019

Four Stars,4.0,It is ok,5 November 2015
Good,5.0,"Review after 19 days use:-I am using it oftenly for making:-1) Fish (no oil): good taste; frying fish without oil is like a dream. Taste is good, but I won't say that it will taste exactly like oil fried fish.2) Chicken: I am using light spices and no oil for making chicken and it comes out like fried-baked chicken. Taste is okay.3) Ready to make product (generally needs oil for cooking):-McCain smileys: Good (no difference just like deep fried ones), French fries: good, kebabs n other non veg food were good too.Overall it might not give the exact deep fried taste, but it is still healthier compared to it!Now about the product:-* Operating it is easy (there are only two dials on it for controlling temperature and setting time)* Basket has one red button on top for detaching purpose (Place the bucket on an even surface before pressing that red button; read manual for brief explanation).Tips:-Read the instructions carefully before using it for the first time ( please, for God's sake read the manual! It will give you a proper viewpoint of how to take care of it and all..)",21 January 2017

It's closing and opening mechanism is also not working satisfactory. Many times it is not closed properly. The design of air fryer should be like oven, where we can see the food condition.

I contacted American Micronic India through this forum and immediately within 2 days the American Micronic India management contacted me and promptly sent me a set of screws by courier. This I must say is excellent after sales service as well. I now have confidence that I will get good customer service from American Micronic even in future.

I now air-fry sweet potato, potato chips, banana chips and even roast aubergines for the classical Indian 'bharta'. I would highly recommended the air-fryer to the diabetic, the cholesterol-conscious and those who need to watch their waistlines!

Absolutely blown away by this wonderful product and how technology has permitted frying with little ...,5.0,"Absolutely blown away by this wonderful product and how technology has permitted frying with little to no oil. I have tried items from Chicken kababs, Barbecued Chicken breast fillets, crisping fried sardines and even lijjat papad. Worked every single time other than the first instance where I did not flip chicken periodically resulting in slightly dry and rubbery texture. The timings,  temperature adjustments and constant flipping might not come to you naturally and is definitely an acquired skill. People who complain of food getting dried might not have flipped the items regularly as that is the mistake I too did initially. Cooking effort required is so ridiculously minimal that even a kid can cook in the fryer. American Micronix customer care was very responsive to my WhtsApp query regarding the recipes and sent me 3 PDFs. My advice is discard the recipe book - The product lets you experiment without any risks involved. If it can be fried in oil, it ought to work in air fryer.",20 June 2018
Heating is not as powerful as an oven but it can easily substitute deep frying in oil,4.0,"I have been using it for a month now. It works very well for baking small cakes, muffins, dhokla and roasting vegetables. Heating is not as powerful as an oven but it can easily substitute deep frying in oil. Would have given 5 star if it came with baking/ grilling accessories.",2 August 2017
Good Value for money,4.0,"Easy to operate, max temperature is restricted to 200 degrees, not sure if this is good or bad. I feel The bottom plate holes/pores should have been little smaller. The paste flows into it and glues the items.",8 July 2017
Product quality is top class but its usage is limited,4.0,"Why decided to buy a air fryer ?I discovered that the main culprit for many diseases that we suffer is ""oil"". Whether it is diabetic or cancer or digestive problems, the usage of excessive oil plays a big role. In the past people consumed very little oil since fried items occupied a very small place in their diet. But today we eat fried items along with main diet as well as snacks. Particularly the quality of oil that is generally used is very poor. We buy oil at the cost of Rs 100 per litre. At this cost there is no way a good quality could be made and sold. So obviously we are buying only low quality oil in the name of cooking oil. When we buy chips, samosa, french fry, puff etc. they are prepared using palm olein oil. People may google on this oil to find out its ill effects.What is the solution ?Ideal solution is to drastically cut the fried items from our diet. But that is a very hard decision. It will require lot of will power to make that choice and follow it properly. So for most of us alternate options are needed. In my opinion ther are two options available 1). Oven 2). Air fryer.Oven Vs Air fryerBoth follow a complete different technology. Comparing to a microwave oven an air fryer follows a very simple mechanism. It has a heating coil and a fan. It simply circulates heat air around the food item place inside the fryer. I dont understand how Philips charging such a huge price for a very simple and inexpensive technology. Whereas a oven is more complicated. It is also slightly risky to handle comparing to a air fryer. We can not place any utensil on oven, only glass and microwave safe plastic container allowed. No stainless steel permitted. But it is not restricted in air fryer. In my opinion oven is a complete cooking equipment. One can prepare any dish just with over. But air fryer is only for frying.How effective and useful is air fryer ?The answer is mixed. It does help inn preparing fries with no or minimal oil but the taste is not equivalent to the oil fried version. Only need to be health conscious to consume them without complaining. The hot air blown dries the food item. So you will feel the items getting harder. It is better to apply small amount of oil over them items before putting insider the airfryer. Im yet to try many dishes using my air fryer. Another problem with air fryer is that it needs lots of practice to make food items properly. So one need patience.How is the brand American Micronic ?I bough this brand based on the overwhelming positive reviews. In terms of price this is neither too cheap not too costly. Nowadays there are many air fryers in the price range of 3000 to 4000. I feel this product is a little overpriced. 5000 will be apt for this model. The quality of the product is satisfactory. The build quality and the frying non-stick utensil quality are really good.  In spite of this high price they do not provide a printed recipe book. They only mail or whatsapp the book.Overall opinionIf you are determined to buy a air fryer after all your analysis and you do not mind spending 5800 rupee then American Micronic air fryer is good choice. If you do not know much about air fryer and its uses then first analyze that and see whether you and your family will bear the dry food items that will be made out of air fryer. I see lot of people reselling their air fryers since they do not like the fried items made with them. Good luck.",2 January 2019
Good to operate and maintain. VFM.,4.0,"Air fryers are great for health conscious and bachelors, with the hassled free cooking. No need to worry about the gas - just plug and play.This own is very easy to use. Just ensure not to convert 3.5 lts to 3.5 kgs. Maximum it will hold is 1.2 kgs (chicken or paneer).The temperature setting works fine (Used around 50-55 times).Only thing, I issue is that paint has started to come off(after few 5-7 rough usages). Researching if it can repainted - with no harm thoughI feel the company should be ready with spares especially the baskets, as those who took this 2-3 years ago, would be needing them soon, if not now.My rating is 4.5/5 where 3 is satisfied.",22 June 2020
Great purchase!,5.0,"Have used it about 10 times now and I have to say that this is one of our best purchases so far. For those who have tried-and-hated OTGs but cannot get a traditional convection oven, this is heaven sent. I have made brownies, fries and bread in this and it has worked out beautifully! It is also very silent. The best part - the capacity offered for the price, way better than others.",30 March 2018
"Easy to use, Healthy and flavour rich food fryer",5.0,"This is my first hand experience with airfryer. I went for American Micronic because of its value for money. In less money it provides better capacity and a higher wattage, which is essential for cooking food at high temperatures and in large volume.I loved the already provided reviews along with their determination (as stated in description) to help customer even if warranty is over. I contacted them before buying to ask for dimensions and the response was fast and professional.About cooking I tried Bharva Karela, Samosa, French fries and Pakodas ,etc. , Everything came out well. It does takes a lot of pratice though to master any food item in air fryer. So have patience. Also my suggestion is to buy few accessories like oil brush, silicon gloves, silicon cup cake moulding.Overall its a great product go for it.I will update this if I have to take customer service at any point of time in future.",11 July 2020
Useful for 4/5 members of the family,4.0,I am using this product foe more than a month. It is very good quality product easy to use and cleaning after its use.

Overall nice product. only drawback is that the company does not provide the recipe book along with the product.,28 June 2019
Waste of money,1.0,"Although it was supposed to be a great product by a good company, however I am utterly disappointed with the performance and output of this air frier. Plugs get overheated, inside is difficult to clean and there’s no manual or recipe instructions. After using it a few times, I have put it down for infrequent uses. Other than baking, it’s useless.",15 July 2020
Nice product,5.0,"V nice to make potato chips, crispy vegetables, even cake n pizzas. Should send a cooking guide in hard copy...but they send it thru whats app. Annodised or steel basket option should be made available for those who dont want to use non stick utensils.

excellent!,5.0,"Just got the product a few days ago. First use has been excellent. Had really crispy fries and Potato Wedges with no extra oil. The best was Idli Fry, with just a brush of oil... so crisp outside and soft inside. The company should provide with a demo DVD and recipe book like other manufacturers.",10 April 2016
Cooking made little easy with little change in taste,5.0,"It made my life easy when I'm alone and hungry. Just put something and slide in, after few mins you get food. But don't expect food tastes same as traditional cooking. There is little change in taste, but still taste is similar.Pros: It is everything that it says.Cons: Nothing. Just that base doesn't insert properly. The gap at the side isn't a big deal.Tips:1. Use power socket that is meant for high Watts, else socket heats up like crazy.2. Use less spices and oil. Unlike in traditional cooking, food doesn't absorbs much of spices and oil. All the spices will be on surface.3. To boil sweet potato, cut it into few pieces of 1 - 2 inches. Upper layer will be little crispy, but it will be boiled inside.4. Don't try papad. It doesn't work (or maybe I don't know the trick yet)It is shipped inside 2 carton boxs. Added safety while shipping.",17 March 2018

Near perfect....,4.0,"Generally good product. Perfect for fries, wedges and all such frozen items The roasting takes a little longer than expected, even though the stated wattage is higher than most other brands. Possibly because the pan is larger (3.2 ltr) compared to most. An ideal product would be a wider base, even if not so deep (e.g. if I have make paneer kababs for around 6 people, I have to do it in two rounds else they just have to be piled on top).
