    "\n",
    "The web has made it possible for organizations to discover what customers are saying about their brands online, either in mainstream media like online newspapers and magazines, or on social media. \n",
    "\n",
    "Consumers now search for opinions online before, during, and after a purchase. The next step for brands is finding out whether people are talking positively or negatively about their brand, and why. \n",
    "\n",
    "Some online ratings provide a number but not the reasoning behind it, and may only present half of the story. The process of analyzing a user's opinion or sentiment about particular services or products and their features is called opinion mining or sentiment analysis. \n",

    "It became an important task for online merchants to enable their customers to review or to express opinions on the products that they have purchased and use this feature to enhance customer experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our clients want to launch a new product and want to understand the reviews of the competitors to see what are the challenges faced by consumers. Hence want to improve the respective features to address the challenges. Thus  the newly launched product should have enhanced features.\n",

On my first try for this product i tried using mccain potato cubes in this. I started the fryer, and wall was going great for 4-5 mins until suddenly the heating light went off, i thought it was a cycle thing, but 10-15 sec later , the power light went off while the timer was still running as it is spring based. I tried to take the container out and re-insert it. the power and heating lights went online, and that is when i realised as i left the handle that these were pressure based and as soon as i left the pressure on the handle , there might have been a connection problem due to loose grip, the lights went off again. I gave it 2-3 more tries , normally holding it thinking it was a one off thing. But the same happened over and over again. Then i immediately ordered a return which was quick.Although there was a problem in the piece, i lost the interest in the product itself, the potato bites did actually get cooked properly, but i lost the trust in the mechanism.

It got delivered in a day. To my utter disappointment, the air fryer stopped working on the first day itself. It was simply dead. I ordered replacement and the replacement air fryer came in another 24 hours. I was kinda sceptical at this point and tried the air fryer, immediately after it arrived. To my surprise, it had few minor scratches here and there but I paid least attention towards them and tried using the air fryer. It worked! I am writing this review after around 2-3 months of usage and can say that it is working quite nicely. Have made many dishes and the experience has been good. It's not very good when it comes to deep fried items like Pakora or Samosas but it definitely is a good replacement for normal shallow frying and grilling.

Remains hot from inside for much longer time than we do fry on pan or even in tandoor. So happy to buy and eat food cooked in this air fryer.Cons: The lock for frying pan gets stuck, manufacturer Inalsa must think of this point to avoid annoyance of the user.Also they should try to use electronic timer instead of mechanical one for these product if not done already.', 'date': '18 August 2020'}, {'title': 'Poor design and Quality.

As after 10 mins, I had to shake the fries, it stopped working and took lots of adjustment which was a mood spoiler. The next lot i.e. third time it stopped working at all and it's all due to poor mechanism.To summarise:- Product is easy to use and clean provided it's in use.-If it works well, don't expect it to be a lasting product as build quality is filmsy.- The unlock mechanism of fryer is faulty and can lead to unlocking of fryer from base and base will fall down too while removing contents.Based on the above retuning my product and will look for something better.\", 'date': '28 July 2019'}, {'title': 'Value for money', 'rating': 4.0, 'body': \"Nice thing.
