HIGHLY DISAPPOINTED WITH THE PRODUCT!!!,1.0,"I really wish there was a provision to award zero stars, that is the level of disappointment with the product.We had been wanting to purchase this air fryer for a long time and it has definitely not been worth the wait. Not only was handle of the air fryer broken but was also covered with scratches. Furthermore, the cardboard which was supposed to hold the fryer in place was torn in different places. This is the second time that we are receiving a defective product in just a span of two weeks. We are paying a good amount of money for the product and we deserve a product free from defects. I have ordered another 10 items on Amazon, I wonder how those are going to turn up....If this trend of defective products keep continuing, it is almost not worth purchasing from Amazon anymore.",5 September 2020
Defective products and Delivery nexus,1.0,A damaged and already used product was sent by the seller. After multiple attempts to return/exchange the product the seller has ensured that delivery team continuously fail product verification citing false reasons and didn’t pick the product. Looks like a nexus is being run around this where customers are sent defective items and then delivery team plays hand in gloves with seller. Amazon also is unable to take any action against this practice.,6 September 2020
"don't go by the product dimensions, its the box dimensions",2.0,"The specifications on amazon says product dimension is 35cm x 35 cm x 37.8 cm, however that's not the product dimension, that's the box dimension (post packaging). The product itself is very small (philips website shows the actual dimension 28.7 x 31.5 x 38.5 and capacity of basket as 28oz which google says is 0.8 liter, which is further different from what we received .. which is somewhere around 29 cm x 29 cm x 31 cm height). There is no mention of the 'liters' or volume capacity of the pan and I had gone by the product dimensions to think of it as a large unit as it was just slightly small than the Havells 6.5 liter unit. We generally trust amazon on such stuff. However, this one is super small in terms of the pricing Vs product capacity. Please beware, the product size doesn't justify the price ! Amazon really needs to pull up the seller in this case as he is giving wrong information. No complaints about amazon service, though ! They promptly took the unit back and refunded as per their policy",15 September 2020
Buy at your own risk,1.0,"Received fake product twice after replacement also happened same, philips is Korean company and made in China was written on the product and product was not same as mentioned in image.",25 June 2020
Used product delivered,1.0,A used product was delivered. We had gifted this and the pack was opened only today. Oil stains were seen and oil smell also felt.  Now it is beyond returnable period. Feel cheated,11 December 2020
Useful product but not ergonomic,3.0,"Works well as an air fryer. Very easy to clean. However, could have been more user-friendly. No pilot lamp to know whether power is on (available on some versiond, but not on this one). Very rudimentary user manual - gives no useful information at all, and the design of the timer rotary knob makes it very difficult to set time accurately.",6 December 2020
Recipe book NOT included in the package as described in the product details and its content,1.0,The RECIPE BOOK and Warranty card as mentioned in the product details were NOT included in the package.Please arrange to deliver the recipe book,23 June 2020
Defective piece,1.0,Please dont buy online. Its waste of money. I wonder what fun the seller gets by sending defective piece. The body got heated up too badly and the fan wasnt working.,28 June 2020
NOT HAPPY,2.0,"Received the product, there was no instruction manual accompanying the fryer. A skimpy printout, in a million languages, extremely brief and uninformative. I am extremely disappointed, at least a basic recipe book is a must. I had expected a better accompaniment from a reputed company, like Philips. There is no way the cord retracts, as mentioned. Am sorry that the product is non-returnable, else I would have opted for it at once. An expensive trinket for the kitchen DISAPPOINTED, TOTALLY. Am stuck with it. A total NO-NO.",24 February 2021
Get the correct instructions for proper  useage of the product.,1.0,"I am afraid I cannot give an opinion on the product as it has not been used so far. There are no clear instructions nor a brochure illustrating the proper useage of the product. I do not want to damage the product without proper instructions. This is an expensive product !I would be grateful if I can get proper instructionson for its useage. I am sure it is a very good product, but I have to  first use it. Hope I can get positive response from concerned department on my query.Thank you,Rajiv Menon",17 December 2020
No after sales service in my location,2.0,"There was no product demo online, nor did any person visit to demo the usage.It was a bad after sales service experience in my location.I tried contacting philips customer care fpr hours, but never got connected to any of their operatives.I am clueless how to use it and the fear of burning away the air frier keeps me from using the product.",28 November 2020
Think before you buy. Check other brands as well,3.0,"Demo provided by company after 8days and when used for first time, it stopped working within 15min. Logged complaint with Philips n they said can repair but denied aa new product. Logged complaint on national consumer forum n Philips replaced product in 10days.Bought on 27oct and got replacement on 28nov",2 December 2020
Looks good but no user manual or cooking guide,2.0,Package and delivery was up to mark. Thanks Amazon. There is no user manual ot cooking instructions help documents included with it. If you buy from Chroma you get the same. Manual attachment on discription page is corrupted and unable to access it.Now will have to check on you tube..will provide more feedback once I use it.,27 October 2020
Not worth the money...too much hype of electric fryer,2.0,"Its not so sophisticated...not sure why they charge so much in the name of a electric fryer. Once started there’s no button to stop or pause, even when you take out the tray the fry still runs....I hope someone would have already figured out to make an electric fryer with a small fan on top of a heating coil",19 December 2020
"Product has scratch on the teflon coating, no booklet",3.0,"Really disappointed by the Air Fryer. There was no instruction guide,  recipe booklet, warranty card, etc. Looks like a used product.

Faulty Product Delivered,1.0,"The product should be checked before dispatch by seller weather it is in working condition as quality check. Why the faulty product delivered by such big brand. Further Amazon has removed the option of return. Customer faith has been shaken after buying branded without option of return the product , if it is faulty.",29 October 2020
Malfunctioning Fryer,1.0,"I have used air fryers before and never had this problem. The basket is not going into the air fryer. I have not even used it once properly. How am I supposed to cook anything if the basket is not locked into the fryer?Why is amazon sending so many defective products like this. Don't you guys do quality checks.Waste of 10,000. If I can give zero stars I would.",22 November 2020

Nice Product! Express Shipment! Misssing Warranty Card and Recipe book! NOT a Philips India Product,2.0,"I still haven't used the product. The packing was good, but it's missing the warranty card & recipe book. The box has all information written in Mandarin or Malay language, which has actually created doubt in my mind. So, I called Philips India customer care, after talking to couple of associates I got to know that this is NOT a Philips India product. This model is sold in Singapore & Malaysia region, and has been imported in India by the Retailer, I guess.Associates also told me that Philips will provide a global 2 years warranty for this product, but there might be an issue in getting the spare parts in India during service/repair. So, things might get tougher after 2 years.Also, would like to highlight what Amazon has been doing, they have merged the Ratings & Reviews of the flagship product HD9220 (viva collection) into product page of HD9218 (that's why I wondering how come Amazon got more than 1800 reviews in such a small time.Guys, I just wanted to say to check the authenticity of this product/model before buying it from any online retailer. You can better look for some other models which are displayed on Philips India site.",28 June 2020
Outdated technology at double the price,1.0,This isn't even worth 5k anymore. This is the most basic analog fryer in the entire Philips catalog. This doesn't even have presets for ease of use! Washing is a pain unless you spend time to soak it. The world has moved on to air fryers with complete digital interface and presets and here we are willing to shell out 10K for a product that doesn't even come with a recipe book. Talk about India being the dumping ground for outdated technology at premium prices.Go for a simple convection OTG at less than half the price and better cooking results.,30 September 2020
Bad exprience,1.0,"Delivered on 16.10 with Broken bucket handle, dust on the outer side of airfryer, no receipe book, no warranty card, damaged carton when delivered first time..& on 2nd time product replaced on 20.10 in good condition but still no warranty card & receipe book there. I didnt use this product till now hence can't say about ""easy to use/clean & flavor""  overall Do not expect from co like phillips & amazon. Very bad exprience. Never recommend to buy from there. It's better to buy from market. 1 Out of 10 if i score",22 October 2020
No user manuals!??,3.0,For one of the better air fryers in the market it’s quite disappointing that you provide no user manual or instructions or a recipe booklet for the applianceJust a bland 1 page  with temperature guidelinesSome additional info on how to best use it and make good healthy foods would have been niceIf you have some more docs please send,23 February 2021
