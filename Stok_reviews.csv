Service not available even in metro city like Lucknow.,1.0,Its not working after just 3 small uses.Company asking to send product to Delhi on my own risk and cost for sending & receiving back.Feeling like cheated by purchasing this product.,3 December 2019
Amazing & Beautiful,5.0,Perfecto!!,19 September 2019
"Read this review for real experience, blame me if you regret your decision.",5.0,"Hello guys,I am a gym freak and I bought this because I can't eat boiled chicken and I don't want to use oil to grill/fry my chicken and now I have been using this from 6 monthsDAILY and not even a single issue.Works like a charm. Cooks perfect grilled chicken in 12 mins. Tried French fries and it went GREAT, I re heat my tiffin in it, that's also possible and it's a oven at better priceI love it and you should buy it as there will not be any day you will not use it as it's so amazing.",7 February 2020
Need Indian cuisine  guidelines,5.0,"It is designed in western country . It suits their requirements.  But for Indian cooking a bit more experience and practice is required.  Then only we can comment.  Apart from  fries and chips,  there are some light fry items for which only experience can help.  More trial  and error.",15 October 2019
Worst,1.0,Stopped working after 5 uses ! The company is asking to send the product to delhi at my own cost. The product is so heavy if i bare the costs of the courier then whats the point of buying this product? Complete cheating! Cant even return the product. Waste of so much money!,10 April 2020
Not worth,1.0,Its absolutely  cheap product.  Not meant for efficient and effective cooking.  Too noisy. It's always better to buy branded product. Rest all are cheap copied Chinese assembled ineffective air fryer including STok.,12 December 2019
Perfect elegant value for money air fryer,4.0,"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.


  ¬†06th-June-2020 : Review after first useWith so many options for air fryer one can easily be confused while buying it.Almost all of these air fryer provide same features like max 200 degree temperature and 30 min timer but where 'stok fry by air' stands out from the rest is it's capacity of 4.0 ltr and 1500 watt power with much less price than other brands.Additionally, it provides a grill stand and a recipe book. The pan and cooking basket is easy to wash and dish washer safe.Product size is bigger than what I expected as there is no size comparison in product image description.4.0 ltr capacity is more than sufficient for a family of 4 to 6.The red color stands out and looks beautiful.STok is a local Indian home appliance brand which is the reason it's cheaper than other brands. Bought this after recommendations from a relative.Observed a lot of price change for this product as min. as Rs 5200 to Rs 6000. Finally bought this on offer for Rs 5499 with 10% instant cashback.Tried frozen french fries, tikki and nuggets with a thin coating of oil by brush and it tastes exactly like deep fried.Overall, it's a great value for money.",6 June 2020
Made in china and chinese company,1.0,Made in china. The fryer is not build sturdy and takes longer than my philips air fryer. The digital keypad is cheap build quality. No lical service center. You need to ship the faulty unit on your own expense,2 June 2020
Boss Air frier,5.0,It is a great product. The instructions are easy and the recipie booklet that comes along is great. Healthy oil less recipes. Very happy with the purchase.  Thank u Amazon,25 May 2020
Awesome product!!!,5.0,The product is running flawlessly. I like this air fryer. I have cooked some traditional Indian snacks which tend to be deep-fried and unhealthy yet tasty in this fryer and they came out to an impeccable facsimile of the deep-fried snacks.  I don't even find it necessary to brush the bottom of the container with oil so that the final goodie doesn't stick to it. It is like a blessing for the ones who are very much concerned about their healthy lives.,23 May 2020
A healthier way to relish fried food!,5.0,"Does the job as advertised. We tried preparing large pieces of chicken with minimal oil and within 11-12 mins it was fried like it was made tandoor, Frozen Fries take 6-7 mins.Looks elegant in Red, enhancing the kitchens aesthetics.The variety of preselect options give you ease of selections. The preheating sometimes may feel like a time waste but hey you‚Äôre getting healthier with almost similar taste to oil fried food.Love the addition.",1 August 2020
Large size is spacious & essential. Useful! Recommend! No user manual. unprofessional.,4.0,"Pros- Till now doing its job well. Spacious compared to others, can cook a whole pizza too. Roasts & bakes too. Looks good.Recommend bigger size, much more useful for larger portions.Cons - User manual not included so figuring out temperatures & duration myself.Timer function default set to 10 mins. Most things I cook require a 4-6 minute operation (implying too many taps to reduce time in to 4/5 minutes).",2 October 2020
"Good, but not bad",4.0,"Overall Appliance is good, i would say it is better than Philips or Prestige, the Operation is smooth and easy, it has built in functions for barbeque, deep fry and to bake.Pros.1.Very easy to operate2.Has some preloaded functions3.Full digital control4.Barbeque grill is also provided5.Very low Noise operationCons.1.Very heavy2.Heat dissipation could be better3.Not that rigid handlesOverall it is best for those who are new to air frying world, and those who want to experiment their style of cooking",16 July 2020
Pathetic After sales Service,1.0,Machine got faulty in 1 year J am based in Mumbai but Company telling to send machine to Delhi for repairs!!!. This was not disclosed at time of purchase by Amazon or Company. Buy branded like Phillips etc Atleast we will get service. This is patheticAvoid this Stok company even if they give free,26 November 2020
Amazing Product,5.0,The product is just as described. Super fast delivery. Works like a charm. Oil free cooking for a healthy living. Compared to other Air Fryers that I've used in the past this is the best. Would certainly recommend purchasing the product.,30 May 2020
Worth for Money,5.0,"I was looking for an Airfryer and reading many reviews and ratings for different brands. Finally, I chose this one as it had a capacity of 4L and was coming for a reasonably fairer price. Its been 2 months I am using this and it's doing great. The only thing that bothers me is non-veg sticks to the bottom of the pan. But it can be easily cleaned by just soaking it in water.  I have cooked zero oil Fish and chicken fry in it, which exactly tastes like deep-fried ones. It also has few presets which make things easy. If someone is looking for a good air fryer in a decent price, this is the one.",29 July 2020
Awesome and useful,5.0,"I liked this Stok air fryer because it replaces oil and fries using air. And it is useful when it has different ways to adjust the food we keep in through those 4 or 5 categories which are chips , mutton, shrimps and fish.",15 January 2020

Decent Air fryer at modest rate by stok,4.0,"Turned to be quite decent after 1 day use, I tried preparing üê†üêãüêü and it turned out as I was expecting, it was quite crispy without any oil... Decent Product can go for it",3 November 2019
Nice product.,4.0,The air fryer appears good. I own the Philips air fryer as well. Stok air fryer is a bit lighter but is good. There is proper design to let hot air blow in from side ways which helps frying.Nice product on the whole,25 January 2021
Works as expected,5.0,"Working very well. Used for a month. Used it to make samosa, french fries, broccoli and heat up outside food-it gets crispy and fresh",4 February 2021
Pathetic don't buy,1.0,"The product is pathetic , it doesn't on, and call center guys say courrier it to delhi, within 15days the product has stopped functioning..Why can't you guys give a refund immediately, when the issue is in product",7 August 2020
Worth the price,4.0,Well the air fryer is worth the cost and price. This one takes longer to cook and to adjust and that may have to do with Fan Speed which i believe is a bit on lower side. Overall good purchase considering the price.,2 February 2021
Bad product.,1.0,It doesn‚Äôt evenly cook everything.,23 July 2020

It was a lifesaver for me during the lockdown as I can't cook to save my life.

I recommend it to everyone.",8 October 2020

Find place for this wonderful kitchen companion... especially if you love to cook!,4.0,"we received this on December 25. and I had already seen a lot of videos on how-to use it. also purchased some accessories like separation Stand, barbecue skewers Non stick pan, etc. for one month from that day... I have only been cooking and heating and thawing in it.we don't use the microwave oven... we use conventional oven. and now I am not using the induction also.if you have kids then just for making fryums type snacks and McCain frozen foods... this is more than worth it.I took this machine to my nephew's birthday party and grilled some chicken for him as a gift. and he loved it.Chicken dishes, grilled paneer, pizzas, converting rotis to khakras, roasting nuts... and the best item of all... fried bhindis and broccoli! we also made Falafels in it.I settled on This StoK machine cause it seemed to be the largest.I would have preferred manual rotating dials for controls, rather than the touch panel type. Because our experience is that these panels eventually spoil.So I put a wide cellophane tape on it hoping it will protect the mebrane.I also bought extra one year policy from Amazon.but for this price it's a sweet deal... it it lasts two years I'm Happy! I have also dropped the inner pan once because of pressing the locking button accidentally. be careful with that.I don't usually write here but I think those who are confused should feel confident and get it.Get rid of some other items in the kitchen,  of keep it in the balcony. I actually only had space in the bedroom... so that's where it is. If we're cooking a lot of messy things then we bring it dowstairs to the kitchen.I keep a cloth and then place it over the induction stove as it is quite light.",1 March 2020
Nice at this price 4600,4.0,Product is fine....capacity is 4lt at this price is amazing... but product plastic should be better...mine one is creating some fan blade noise.... amazon created a replacement for me..let me c ... thanx amazon,12 October 2019
