Further feedbacks after using the device.June 21, 2020I used the product for the first time to fry fish my favourite delicacy. I set at 200 C for 10 min after pre-heating for 3 min at 180 C. The fish was very well done with crisp exterior and was cooked well inside. I loved it. Except that the cleaning with take a while since I was unable to remove the mesh from the tray. But no big hassles. Since I liked the outcome of the cooking, I am changing the rating to 4 from 1. I was disappointed that they couldn't provide a recipe book. I have downloaded their Airfyer App which includes the recipes. Further updates later.",20 June 2020
No recipe book!!,4.0,"It is definitely easy to use n totally mess free but it Is definitely not easy to clean. My biggest complaint is that there is no recipe book with the airfryer.

Cooking is great, no loss of flavor even with minimal / no oil.- Looks amazing. Sleek.- Great tech.Cons- For the price, we should have at least had an auto-pause mechanism when the basket is pulled out mid-way cooking to stir the contents.- No LED / digital indicators.- Mechanical clock does not stop ticking even if you pull the basket out / power is off.Overall a decent purchase. I have no complaints as the pros outweigh the cons (which are good-to-haves rather than must-haves)",3 March 2021

How the food went.....,5.0,"It's pretty easy to use once you figure it out. However when we tried frying french fries, it didn't come out the usual yellow-golden way, but tasted exactly as you would in a McDonald's happy meal. We tried frying fish. In the insides it tastes just ""cooked"" and not ""bursting with flavors "" as in the case of traditional frying. The crust is crispy and the insides are tender. Do not overcook such that a black layer forms on it. Its acrylamide, and is hazardous.",23 January 2021

I would say it makes some of the kitchen works easy for my mom.. but little bit unsatisfied with the iron mesh provided with this model , even though the machine costs around 10k , iron mesh attracts so much of food and it just sticks and getting it out and cleaning it is really tough.

BEST - NO DOUBT AT ALL,4.0,"Got this airfryer for lowest prince in Amazon - Thanks a lot to Amazon for that.SELLER FORGOT TO SEND RECIPE BOOK. DOWNLOADED IT FROM NET. SO ONE STAR LESS.AMUL FRENCHFRIES, THOUGH COSTLY, CAME OUT BEST. SAMOSA using home made masala and costly  SwitzSheets was quite good. Groundnuts - ok. Will try veg kebabs & other indian snacks soon.VERY SIMPLE TO USE.WORKS PERFECTLY. VERY SATISFIED WITH PHILIPS AIR FRYER.POINTS BEFORE YOUR BUYING DECISION:==================================1. BIG BRANDS FROM INDIA ALSO SELL MADE IN CHINA ITEMS. BEWARE OF THAT.2. DO NOT BE LURED BY NON-STANDARD AIRFRYER WITH LED BUTTONS AND LED SCREEN AND TOUCH SCREEN INTERFACE. I BOUGHT A WASHING MACHINE BASED ON IT AND FOR RS.15000/- DAMN MACHINE WORKED TWICE. LATER ONLY LED SCREEN GLOWED SUPERBLY. NO WASHING MECHANISM. REPAIR MECHANIC SAID IT'S WORTHLESS I POINTED TO REPAIR MECHANIC THAT LED GLOWS SUPERBLY AND DIGITAL DISPLAY SHOWS THE SELECTION  CLEARLY. SO PERHAPS A MINOR PROBLEM BECAUSE PRODUCT WAS NEW. REPAIR MECHANIC'S REPLY WAS, SO DOES THE LED OF A 500 rs mobile phone or 50 rs electronic watch. But can they do the washing?'THEN I BOUGHT A BRANDED MICROWAVE OVEN. USED IT ONLY FOR A YEAR - DAMAGED BECAUSE LED PANEL GOT DAMAGED AND CHANGING IT WOLD COST JUST Rs. 2500/- Well, COST OF NEW BRANDED MICROWAVE IS 5000/-MORAL - DIFFERENCE IS USABILITY AND USER EXPERIENCE.GO FOR RELIABLE USABILITY.SLICK LED PANELS AND LED LIGHTS AND COOL BUTTONS ARE FOR USER EXPERIENCE.

Very useful equipment in the kitchen.,5.0,"I have been using an air fryer for some time (different brand).I made Salmon and BBQ Chicken on the first day. Both came out very well. A lot of cooking instructions are available on Youtube for free.The only issue is, in India we get only smaller size Air Fryers a bigger family might have limitation on the quantity of food that can be made at a time.",17 August 2020
Needs lot of training,4.0,"It was first time we bought an air fryer. I wish it comes with a cookery book for Indian dishes.  The small chit which comes as help book is hardly of any use.  Watching YouTube videos you have to experiment since not all use same model / settings.When we used it to fry ready to cook kebabs, it worked well . However making poori , we are yet to crack the formula",16 December 2020
How do you get the add ons with out paying an arm and a leg,5.0,Bought as a Dewali gift for my mother ... great purchase only that the accessories are almost as expensive as the fryer it‚Äôs self .. I have noted that abroad people get muffin cups and other baking accessories with their purchases,10 December 2020
Takes quite a bit of space in an apartment kitchen,4.0,"If you are just going to use it to prepare small quantities, it is not worth it, cost-wise and cleaning-wise. Use for large quantities of food or 2-3 hours of usage. Good for reducing the amount of oil consumed.",5 December 2020
