MUST BUY ..... INALASA AIRFRYER,5.0,IT IS MORE THAN VALUE FOR MONEY HAPPY WITH THE PRODUCT ........ PREPARED FOOD IS VERY DELICIOUS . THANKYOU .... INALSA AND AMAZON FOR PROVIDING SUCH A GOOD PRODUCT TO START OUR DAY WITH OIL FREE DISHES ....,1 March 2019
Low Quality/ Pathetic Customer Support,1.0,"Earlier I gave a positive review, but after using it for 1 month I would like to take back all the good things I said about the product.It is indeed cheap and the polish of the tray is coming off.What is more disappointing is their customer service, who doesn't have any credibility. They make fake commitments all the time whenever contacted.All the best if you've also purchased this item.Unfortunate Buyer,Sumit Saxena",29 September 2019
Easy to use,5.0,Inalsa Air Fryer...this is awesome product ...10/10Value for money 10/10Philips vs inalsa ...inalsa10/10,22 February 2019
Was almost a great product,2.0,"I bought this in the prime day sale on 15th July,  only by the brand value, as inalsa products are great value for money as we also have other products of them. On my first try for this product i tried using mccain potato cubes in this. I started the fryer, and wall was going great for 4-5 mins until suddenly the heating light went off, i thought it was a cycle thing, but 10-15 sec later , the power light went off while the timer was still running as it is spring based. I tried to take the container out and re-insert it. the power and heating lights went online, and that is when i realised as i left the handle that these were pressure based and as soon as i left the pressure on the handle , there might have been a connection problem due to loose grip, the lights went off again. I gave it 2-3 more tries , normally holding it thinking it was a one off thing. But the same happened over and over again. Then i immediately ordered a return which was quick.Although there was a problem in the piece, i lost the interest in the product itself, the potato bites did actually get cooked properly, but i lost the trust in the mechanism. I ll try some other brand some other time now.",23 July 2019
Product has manufacturing defect.,1.0,Product has manufacturing defect as the right side of plastic body found detached.It appears this defect was overlooked as box has no apparent damage.,4 April 2019
Good product at a great price,4.0,"My friend has this Inalsa air fryer since over a year and considering he was very happy with the purchase, I bought this air fryer too at a price of 4377 (plus additional 10% sbi discount). It got delivered in a day. To my utter disappointment, the air fryer stopped working on the first day itself. It was simply dead. I ordered replacement and the replacement air fryer came in another 24 hours. I was kinda sceptical at this point and tried the air fryer, immediately after it arrived. To my surprise, it had few minor scratches here and there but I paid least attention towards them and tried using the air fryer. It worked! I am writing this review after around 2-3 months of usage and can say that it is working quite nicely. Have made many dishes and the experience has been good. It's not very good when it comes to deep fried items like Pakora or Samosas but it definitely is a good replacement for normal shallow frying and grilling. Overall, I am quite satisfied with the purchase.",20 August 2020
Better than expected,5.0,"Excellent way for cooking for veg and Non-veg families. What a perfect nonveg chicken tikka prepared, better than eating outside in hotel, fish fry perfect. Also tried french fries, veg cheese balls, all cooked so well. Remains hot from inside for much longer time than we do fry on pan or even in tandoor. So happy to buy and eat food cooked in this air fryer.Cons: The lock for frying pan gets stuck, manufacturer Inalsa must think of this point to avoid annoyance of the user.Also they should try to use electronic timer instead of mechanical one for these product if not done already.",18 August 2020
Poor design and Quality. Look for something Better.,1.0,"An impulse purchase based on Inalsa Brand name but I am disappointed. Product got delivered on evening of 27July 2019 yesterday and opened this morning 28th. Tried cooking french fries and the product worked flawlessly for the first 10 mins. As after 10 mins, I had to shake the fries, it stopped working and took lots of adjustment which was a mood spoiler. The next lot i.e. third time it stopped working at all and it's all due to poor mechanism.To summarise:- Product is easy to use and clean provided it's in use.-If it works well, don't expect it to be a lasting product as build quality is filmsy.- The unlock mechanism of fryer is faulty and can lead to unlocking of fryer from base and base will fall down too while removing contents.Based on the above retuning my product and will look for something better.",28 July 2019
Value for money,4.0,"Nice thing. We are fond of eating French fries, potato cutlets, samosas and other stuff, it saves a great deal on oil.Best product for the price.Though it they could have arranged for a demo, it would have been the best.Demo person didn't come even after multiple mails and calls. He fixed a date too and even then didn't show up.",14 April 2019
Loose body. Top cover not closing tightly,1.0,Paint of the baking tray coming off.  If its paint then too much bad for health.Then rust developing and that too is ferric red color type rust.Don't know what happened when I used itfor the second time since delivery of the product.  But may be while delivery or manufacturing defect. Top cover not closing completely and due to this the power is turning off. Has to put heavy object over it to let it continue operation. Waiting for Amazon's approval for return or repair.Need to operate for too long to cook completely. The timer is only 30 minutes but one cycle of 30 minutes is enough only for streaming the food. For frying the food it takes more than 1 cycle of 30 minutes,7 July 2019
GOOD Product But Bad Services,1.0,"It was a faulty product. I complaint to their customer care no. And they told me that their technician will pay a visit in 48-72 hrs and see to it But to our disappointment noboby ever came ! I also complained here bt that to was of no use ! Atlast we have to take it to the service center in our city all by ourself and where they very irresponsibly and casually told us ki ""Han complain to aai thi"" and they didn't care in the first place so we had to leave the product there and got the fault fixed after some days ! Now it works fine and is easy to use.. Bt their negligence is just not something that is acceptable!",9 October 2019
MADE IN CHINA,2.0,"I brought this after comparing other fryers displayed on Amazon. The reason I chose Inslsa, even though it was a bit costly than other models, is because it is shown as made in India among the queries section. This is MADE IN CHINA. I wish they are Frank enough to admit it, so that we can make a righteous choice.",16 June 2020

(Almost) the perfect airfryer,4.0,"I'm reviewing this 3 months after my purchase. I use this every weekend. 90% of usage is to make frozen items like chicken popcorn, nuggets, shami kebabs, and frozen samosas.. The device does a great job of cooking these.. The timer and temperature dials are easy to use.  The only problem I've had with the device is that the pan has started to erode in 2 months of light use.. I use a soft sponge to clean it, so that the coating doesn't come off, but in certain parts of the pan rhe coating has come off, which means sometimes food sticks while being cooked",17 October 2020

Perfect product at perfect prices.,5.0,"I wanted to buy an air fryer since long so i bought this inalsa one because i researched alot in the market offline as well as online and many people suggested this one. It is reasonable in price and amazing in quality and also the frying/baking tray is very spacious (2.9L) which is good enough for minimum for a family of 4. It is a very good and healthy alternative for the people like me who love fried food but, are also cautious about their health. I tried alloo tikki in it and it turned out amazing. Crispy on the outside and soft on the inside and the best part was that very very less oil was used. In love with the product. And the delivery service was also very quick. It came early even before the date which was given. And icing on the cake for me was that i bought it in Great Indian Festival sale on Amazon and I got it at an amazing and very reasonable price of Rs 3945. It just wish one thing that they included a grill stand in the box.",18 October 2020

Economical and tasty food,5.0,"I was not sure whether buying an airfryer would prove useful but I must say the Inalsa airfryer is so easy to use that I am using it nearly everyday. I have made a number of non veg items like chicken Tikka and fish ....awesome. It is also good for French fries, stuffed capsicum and patal, heating up patties and pizzas and roasting nuts. Best of all it is economical compared to other brands.",26 December 2020

Defective piece was sent,1.0,"Please dont but from this seller. Was sent defective piece. Had to go on to a call with customer care for  4 hours to explain the issue. Finally, they asked me to go to a service center to get it repaired as the price of the air fryer is too less to get a technician sent over. In these CoVid times, I had to search for a service center and they took the item for a week to get it repaired. Horrible and disappointing experience.  I am sure the item was defective - Do not but from this seller.",21 September 2020

   Guys if you are not buying the product  only because of lower Price then this is the one product which COST LESS and MORE EFFECTIVE.

Good one,4.0,"I did a lot of research before buying an air fryer and finally shortlisted a few. We are a family of 5, so I was most inclined to buy a larger size one.

Easy to use, easy to clean, food taste everything is outstanding.Con: Only con, for a week or so, I smell the plastic/something in the food, but now after a week or so, this is all good now.Overall happy with the purchase.",1 November 2020

Good buy,4.0,"A very useful and cost effective product. Can be used for various purposes like frying , baking , roasting etc.  Moreover french fries of excellent quality can be prepared in 20 odd minutes with 1 tablespoon of oil. Interesting gadget to have at home.It’s absolutely worth the money!!! If only the heating could have been more than 200 that would have been great but for the price this is really really nice product. But the time taken was more than 20mins. So yes it’s a bit slow but a very good product.",20 December 2020
"Damaged product recieved, weak handle",4.0,Original package had a hole on side and the product had broken handle. Received replacement which is working fine. One area of concern (reason for not giving 5 stars) is the handle to the basket is made of plastic and with no reinforcement the handle is very delicate. There is always a fear that it might break. If the handle had some kind of metal reinforcement in center then this fryer is best in its lot.,24 October 2020

Defective item,1.0,"Received defective product. Not able to return as Amazon doesnot have the return policy. They have only replacement.

Decent Product but little faulty,3.0,Bought one recently and have started making a few items - they are coming out good but somehow feel the product is a little faulty - basket doesn't close properly and the timer doesn't beep when it goes off. Not too sure if it is my particular product or with the product in general.,17 August 2019
Genuine Review- Worst product,1.0,Worst ever product purchased. Never ever buy Inalsa products. Timer stopped working in just 2 months. Now customer care guys are not responding.The reviews here given by people are false just to extend 6 months warranty but what will be the use of that because Inalsa will not help you if you get any issue with the product.,8 February 2021
Quality not upto the mark,2.0,"It was working quite well in the beginning. However within a couple of weeks it started declining. Two major issues found: One design defect, pan release push button would get stuck. This happening on regular basis. They can solve this problem simply by providing stopper to limit the push button movement.Second one, Thermostat is of poor quality, stops at 5 minutes trying to each their service center, but it is closed in Bangalore.",5 September 2020
Easy to use and Worthy for Money!!,4.0,"Overall i would say it is good and worthy for the money. Its easy to cook and most importantly with minimal oil.

Pathetic Air fryer by Inalsa,1.0,Pathetic product by Inalsa! The top part heats up vigorously with a foul burning smell! The product on arrival was not in a good condition and deliberated with a broken box and no plastic packaging on the airfryer at all - seemed like a return item being thrown at a new customer. Would definitely not recommend it to anyone at all!,24 August 2020
Value for money,5.0,Received in good Packing. Performance is good. Warranty for 2 Years is an extra feature of this product. Though I used sparingly I find no problem for other items as there is no much automation is required. We can happily purchase it.,20 August 2019

Skip this for a Philips,2.0,"The eject button stopped working two weeks after purchase. It's stuck. Amazon decided against helping me out. The frier gives off too much heat around it. The radius is easily 3-4 feet. This is my second Inalsa product that is of such poor quality. If I were you, after this experience, I would pay a bit more and get a Japanese brand.",11 September 2020

Affordable Air fryer with large capacity.,4.0,"We have used this Air fryer on an average 3 times per week in the past one month. So far we have made chips, roasted veggies, cutlets, pizza, and cake. For some items you might need to oil the base a little more.Ideally you can place an piece of foil to collect the excess oil which can prevent the oil from spoiling the base. Try to clean the fryer once it's cooled down but still a little hot. This will make it easier to get the oil out.The size is about half the width of a common microwave.The manual timer can sometimes glitch so you need to be careful that you keep an eye on it.",15 August 2020
THE BESTEST AIR FRYER,5.0,"Just WOW product.comes with very high capacity of 2.9 L food basket and 4.2L pan capacity.ultimate looks.packing is superb.LED indicator light also very good feature in this.

I got the entire unit replaced the second day itself.The control knobs are below average.The replaced one is working well for over two months now without any issues.The taste of food reduces greatly, of course. I little bit of oil or butter can be brushed at the end for taste. Little means, very little.",16 September 2020
Not worth,2.0,"Delivery feedback - unprofessional. Courier guy delivered the item at the security gate of residential complex after discussing with me but reported as ‘delivered direct to customer’ which isn’t appropriate.About item- Bought to have an initial experience of an air fryer. Product doesn’t seem to be of acceptable standards. Even at highest temp i.e. 200 degrees and using as per the recommended time, the food (eg thin home fries) couldn’t get crispy or tender. The demo provided by company isn’t satisfactory as the demo guy himself doesn’t know much about its working. Build quality is also very much average. If Inalsa wants to gain popularity in this segment then they need to improve drastically. Just selling a product for a cheaper price doesn’t help always",7 April 2019
Product is good but customer care app and portal needs improvement.,5.0,Product is good in quality and price. The customer care they need to improve. I registered in INALSA CARE android app with my mobile number and tried to add the product but I could not. Then I registered in their website with email since there was no option to login with already registered mobile number and there was no option to add product in web portal. So there's syncing issue between mobile app and web.,6 November 2020
